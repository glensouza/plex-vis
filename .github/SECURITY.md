# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the maintainer at:

**glenster75@gmail.com**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will send you regular updates about our progress
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure, if you wish (you can remain anonymous if you prefer)

## Security Update Process

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release new security fix versions as soon as possible

## Comments on This Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss.

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason (This includes demonstrating additional risk, such as attempted compromise of sensitive company data or probing for additional issues)
- Do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.

## Attribution

We believe in recognizing security researchers for their valuable contributions. If you would like to be publicly acknowledged for your discovery, we will:

- Credit you in our release notes
- Mention you in our security acknowledgments (if you wish)

Thank you for helping keep this project and our users safe!
